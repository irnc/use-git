Working for multiple projects requires different identities. For example on public projects you need to use your GitHub account, while on private projects your need to use you corporate email address.

Every time when you clone new repository, go into it and set your identity needed for that project:

* `cd project`
* `git config user.name "Pavel Zubkou"`
* `git config user.email "pzubkou@example.com"`
